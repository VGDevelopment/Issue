Even though this isn't the full documentation - this covers almost everything important. As a side-note to all the developers out there, you can now get some free open-source code at https://github.com/VGDevelopment/OpenSource and drop a :star: if you think we should publish more open-source content.

Another cool thing - VGDevelopment finished the website during the 0.6.0 change as well. Isn't that epic?

We're starting multiple platforms to integrate and interest the community such as the #dev channel. If you're a developer among the community, shoot me a DM to be added. If you aren't, well, we soon may have something cool for you later.

..and oh, what's this BedrockPayment stuff? **meh**... probably just some kids making up stuff again. A new payment platform in Minecraft? Whaaa? We'll leave this here. :computer:
